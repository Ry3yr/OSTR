Usually, the thematic "ads" is something you'd not think too hard about.<br>
They're "there" and will be there, until the end of mankind<br>
<br>
You grew up with them, and some might've even been kinda <a target="_blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0p7uJp25BlE#wii-would-like-to-play">good</a>.<br>
<br>
However - even though I usually agree with that stance - updating an app I use quite often ( <a target="_blank" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Utsukushiotosuk/status/1468346493740462081">IbisPaintX</a>),<br>
caused me to rethink this sentiment<br>
<br>
When did ads become so horrible ? So intrusive ?<br>
You open an app, which seems "ad supported" only to be greeted by a loud, unskippable blaring video<br>
<br>
No wonder Tom Scott called the web a <a target="_blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OFRjZtYs3wY">Mess</a>...
<br>
And this is not even the tip of the 'ad supported ice berg',<br>
The trend has worsened seemingly not only in smartphone/tablet apps (Android, iOS, nomatter)<br>
Television ads, aswell as Youtube ads seem to have <a target="_blank" href="https://goodmenproject.com/technology/are-youtube-ads-getting-worse/">gotten worse</a> , louder, mor obnoxious too.<br>
<br>
When the only way to get out of <a target="_blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E">ad hell</a> is to "pay the price",<br>
something seems to be seriously off on this planet...<br>
