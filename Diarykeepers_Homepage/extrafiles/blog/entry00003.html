<br>


Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy ?<br>


An <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/9ij99j/til_that_kingdom_hearts_began_as_a_literal/">unlikely combination</a>, that used to work...<br>


<br>


Most people probably got into the series due to its conception in the early 2000 days, with KHI.<br>


<br>


Its successor, Kingdom Hearts II, or better known by the fanbase "Kingdom Hearts II Final Remix",<br>


is probably among the best known games of the entire franchise,<br>


oddly enough being better in most bases as it's well famed predecessor.<br>


<br>


Whatever your entrypoint into the series was however:<br>


358/2 Days was most likely the last "real" game to stay true to the franchise.<br>


<br>


<br>


Even if you detested the "OrganizationXIII" antics and thought they were "anime-y" and "annoying",<br>


if you managed to get through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-hearts-review/1900-2879719/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">KHI</span></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://middleofnowheregaming.com/2014/12/12/kingdom-hearts-ii-final-mix-review/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">KHII</span></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2011/02/kingdom_hearts_3582_days_ds"><span style="font-weight: bold;">KH358/2</span></a> you most likely changed your mind after these..<br>


(Sidenote: KHI and KII were still developed by the famed "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.khinsider.com/forums/index.php?threads/the-tokyo-team.217451/">Team Tokyo</a>" which was disbanded after KHII,<br>


&nbsp;for profit maximization.358/2 was developed by h.a.n.d. - a very
capable developer that always managed to work best - even with limited
hardware as the DS, most other titles (especially BBS and III that fell
very short - quality wise, by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/doc6sn/why_does_everyone_hate_the_osaka_team/">Team Osaka</a>)<br>


<br>


Sadly the series direction in<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> story telling took a sharp turn</span> with the arrival of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Birth By Sleep</span>.<br>


Not only was unnecessary lore tacked on (infront of KHI, no less) but
new character far outside the current universe were introduced(Those
being Aqua, Ventus and Terra).<br>


<br>


The plot suddenly started to revolve around a person only mentioned in passsing prior (Some Xehanort Chap),<br>


when before the nemesis (or allies if we're talking 358/2) were merly a easy to grasp Organization (of max 14 members)<br>


<br>


It doesn't help that numerous mobilephone spinoffs diluted the mix even further.<br>


<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">

The final coffin being KingdomHeartsIII</span> itself.<br>


Being delayed for several years and getting out of development hell just making the 2019 release date...<br>


Feeling unpolished and underdelivering on any front.<br>


- In fact, it was so bad, that the "Critical Mode" was delivered via
patch, and a later "Re:Mind" -costly- DLC later had to be added in post
to the game...<br>


<br>


<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bottomline:</span><br>


All in all Square Enix and (their current inept dev team) managed to destroy a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyYNCNUtvFk">unique and even sometimes lifelike</a> Gameseries.<br>


All for cheap cash-in and profit maximization on cost of storytelling.<br>


<br>


At this point the only strong point the series has, is the one it had all along:<br>


Its composer.<br>


(And we haven't even touched on the "Gameplay degradation" that occured past 358/2...).<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">A real shame.</span><br>


<br>


Guess "The Heart" wasn't the guiding Key after all.<br>
